"2020/04/01 2:01:23 pm CET","charles.kelly1@ucdconnect.ie","Nasato had no personality. Makoto stopped working but had a good personality ","Makoto","Seemed more human "
"2020/04/01 3:33:01 pm CET","chloe.foxe@ucdconnect.ie","Nasoto opened up about his likes/dislikes more than Makoto. Makoto, reflected my answers positively. Nasoto was a little more negative in how he spoke about disliking lecturers and modules","Nasoto","I preferred interacting with nasoto because I learned about him as the conversation developed. I didnt find out anything about makoto during the conversation so it felt more like I was interacting with a bot."
"2020/04/01 7:08:03 pm CET","elizabeth.burke@ucdconnect.ie","The tone, the second one felt far more automated and less conversational. It was more obvious to me it was a chatbot from the monotone responses","Makoto","It was a nicer Ux because of the conversational tone, there was more enthusiasm which was more enjoyable to respond to "
"2020/04/10 4:11:55 pm CET","elayne.ruane@ucdconnect.ie","yes, the first bot makoto was much nicer","Makoto","Makoto was friendlier and seemed more interested in my answers"
"2020/04/11 12:58:39 pm CET","george.ridgway@ucdconnect.ie","Yes, I felt like the Nasoto allowed for a much more natural conversation.","Nasoto","The conversation I had with Nasoto felt two-sided. I had the feeling that Nasoto was reading and interpreting what I was typing. With Makoto, it felt like a one-sided conversation where I was doing all the talking "
"2020/04/11 1:30:37 pm CET","oisin.quinn@ucdconnect.ie","Nasoto felt more formal. It felt like I was doing an interview. They performed well but the conversation wasn't very exciting. Makoto felt way more relaxed and informal, and they were a lot more fun to talk to. Makoto also seemed to understand my messages more often, but that was probably down to me giving slightly different answers to each chatbot.","Makoto","They were just more fun and relaxed and it was a much more pleasant conversation."
"2020/04/11 11:39:16 pm CET","mohamed.jama@ucdconnect.ie","yes. I found the first bot to be more pleasent experience in that it didn't ask impolite questions like the second bot.","Makoto","it is not rude and the questions it asked allowed for more options to respond in. The question on facilities I was only thinking about the ones it listed only (even tho it said etc.)"
"2020/04/12 2:12:37 pm CET","nikolaj.jasenko@ucdconnect.ie","Yeah, first one was more friendly","Makoto","More interesting to interact with due to a brighter ""personality"""
"2020/04/15 5:01:59 pm CET","kiowa.daly@ucdconnect.ie","Yes, the first bot seems to disregard your response and follow a more linear progression. While the second bot is similar, there is an appearance of genuine conversation. Makoto responds with minute phrases that are common in real life.","Makoto","Makoto is more cheery, nasoto seems to not respond to your actual response but follows a more clinical approach"
"2020/04/15 5:14:04 pm CET","conor.beenham@ucdconnect.ie","Yes. Makoto was friendlier, and seemed more 'interested'","Makoto","resulted in a better, more interesting conversation

"2020/04/15 10:02:56 pm CET","daire.murphy.2@ucdconnect.ie","The second bots personality was much nicer to talk to. It made it feel more like a person talking rather than being asked a list of questions","Makoto","It was sounder to chat to. Better personality "
