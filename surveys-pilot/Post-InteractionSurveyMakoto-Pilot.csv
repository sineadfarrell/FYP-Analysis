It was also an effort to have to specify certain answers, such as saying '13 modules' as it did not understand simply answering '13'","3","Topics were good, transitions between topics were a little abrupt","3","It didn't really have a clear personality to be honest, it was pretty neutral, and the tone was in line with many other chatbots I've used.","Yeah"
